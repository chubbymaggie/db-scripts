## [Upcoming]

* `Comments.UserDisplayName`:  `VARCHAR(30)` â†’ `VARCHAR(40)` (unify the type of all display name columns) 
* create indices for all user display name columns
* add table `PostHistoryTypeId` (see column `Revision` [here](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/36599/show-all-types))

## [2018-02-16] - Release for MSR camera-ready

### Added
* Schema files for importing SOTorrent into Google BigQuery ([db-scripts](http://github.com/sotorrent/db-scripts))

### Changed
*  Improve filename regex ([db-scripts](http://github.com/sotorrent/db-scripts))
    * Prevent matching of directory names starting with "." in table `PostReferenceGH` (for example `.history/17/10db4490e45300171a8a828d7b324fa2`)

### Fixed
*  Order post versions according to `CreationDate` instead of `PostHistoryId` ([so-posthistory-extractor](http://github.com/sotorrent/so-posthistory-extractor/) and [db-scripts](http://github.com/sotorrent/db-scripts))
    * In the SOTorrent 2018-01-18 dataset, 283 posts created in 2008/2009 were not ordered chronologically (see "broken_entries" in "analysis_postversion_edit_timespan.R").
    * Thus, we now order post versions according to their `CreationDate` (instead of using the `PostHistoryId`).
    * Updated database schema and class `PostVersion to include new member variable `CreationDate`.
* Fixed import and export scripts ([db-scripts](http://github.com/sotorrent/db-scripts))
* Replaced newline character in GitHub path, which was present in two rows of table PostReferenceGH ([db-scripts](http://github.com/sotorrent/db-scripts))

## [Obsolete]

* `UserId`/`OwnerUserId` is `null` in some cases. Then, the  `UserDisplayName` has to be employed to identify users. This applies for tables `Comments`, `PostHistory`, `Posts`. Idea: Find the corresponding Ids using `UserDisplayName` and table `Users`, replace the `null` values, and add foreign key constraints, which is currently not possible.
  **UPDATE 2018-03-13:**  533,378 of 5,765,510 `UserDisplayNames` are not unique, thus the approach described above does not work.
